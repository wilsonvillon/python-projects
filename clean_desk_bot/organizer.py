"""
Clean Desk Bot v1

This script organizes files in a specified folder by detecting file extensions
and creating subfolders named after those extensions (e.g., 'PDF_FILES', 'JPG_FILES').

Each file is moved into its corresponding extension-based folder. Useful for 
basic organization of mixed file types in a single directory.

Usage:
- Place your files into the "test_folder" or any target folder
- Run the script to organize files by file type
