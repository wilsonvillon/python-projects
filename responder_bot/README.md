# Responder Bot

**Responder Bot** is a simple keyword-based auto-response tool designed to simulate how a basic customer service assistant might reply to common user inquiries. It analyzes the input text for keywords such as `"order"`, `"support"`, and `"refund"`, and returns helpful responses based on the context of the message.

This project was created as part of my personal Python learning journey, with a focus on real-world problem solving and automation logic.
